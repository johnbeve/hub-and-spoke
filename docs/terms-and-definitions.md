### Definitions
In what follows, definitions are indicated with the use of “=def ”, and those entries regarding classes that lack this symbol are elucidations. First, subclasses of continuant:

- a is an independent continuant =def a is a continuant which is such that there is no b such that a specifically depends on b and no b such that a generically depends on b.
    – material entity – an independent continuant that at all times at which it exists has some portion of matter as continuant part.
        - object – a material entity that manifests causal unity and is of a type instances of which are maximal relative to the sort of causal unity manifested.
        - object aggregate – a material entity consisting exactly of (≥1) object(s) as member(s).
    – a is an immaterial entity =def a is an independent continuant which is such that there is no time t when it has a material entity as con- tinuant part.
        - site – a three-dimensional immaterial entity whose boundaries either (partially or wholly) coincide with the boundaries of one or more material entities or have locations determined in relation to some material entity.

An independent continuant may bear dependent continuants, including:

- generically dependent continuant – an entity that exists in virtue of the fact that there is at least one of what may be multiple copies; it is the content or the pattern that the multiple copies share.
- b is a specifically dependent continuant =def b is a continuant and there is some independent continuant c which is not a spatial region and which is such that b specifically depends on c.
    – realizable entity – a specifically dependent continuant that inheres in some independent continuant which is not a spatial region and is of a type some instances of which are realized in processes of a correlated type.
        - role – a realizable entity that exists because there is some single bearer that is in some special physical, social, or institutional set of circumstances in which this bearer does not have to be and which is not such that, if it ceases to exist, then the physical make-up of the bearer is thereby changed.
        - disposition – a realizable entity such that if it ceases to exist, then its bearer is physically changed, and whose realization oc- curs when and because its bearer is in some special physical circumstances, and this realization occurs in virtue of the bearer’s physical make-up.
            - function – a disposition that exists in virtue of the bearer’s physical make-up and this physical make-up is something the bearer possesses because it came into being either through evolution (in the case of natural biological entities) or through intentional design (in the case of artifacts), in order to real- ize processes of a certain sort.
        – quality – a specifically dependent continuant that, in contrast to roles and dispositions, does not require any further process in or- der to be realized.

From the occurrent portion of the hierarchy, we include the following:

- p is a process =def p is an occurrent that has some temporal proper part and for some time has some material entity as participant.
- temporal region – an occurrent over which processes can unfold.
    – temporal instant – a zero-dimensional temporal region that has no proper temporal part.
    – temporal interval – a one-dimensional temporal region that is con- tinuous, thus without gaps or breaks.
